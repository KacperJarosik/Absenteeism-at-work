# README - Absenteeism Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes absenteeism patterns using machine learning models such as Random Forest and Naïve Bayes. The dataset includes various features like seasons, age, target achievements, and social habits, which are used to predict absenteeism.

## File Information
- **Filename:** `main_eng.ipynb`
- **Type:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Purpose:** Conducts exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and visualization of absenteeism trends.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Training and evaluating classification models (Random Forest, Naïve Bayes)
- Comparison of model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualization of absenteeism distribution by various factors (age, smoking, disciplinary failures, seasons, etc.)

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed before running the notebook:
```
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
```
You can install them using:
```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## How to Use
1. Open the `main_eng.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
2. Run each cell sequentially to process the data, train models, and visualize results.
3. Review the output, including performance metrics and visualizations.

## Results
The notebook generates insights into absenteeism trends and identifies key factors influencing it. The trained models help predict absenteeism based on various input parameters.
